        <p>Rabindranath Tagore ; 7 May 1861 – 7 August 1941) was a Bengali poet, writer, playwright, composer, philosopher, social reformer and painter. He reshaped Bengali literature and music as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful" poetry of Gitanjali, he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his "elegant prose and magical poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. Referred to as "the Bard of Bengal", Tagore was known by sobriquets: Gurudeb, Kobiguru, Biswokobi.

          A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha ("Sun Lion"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics.By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent critic of nationalism, he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy also endures in his founding of Visva-Bharati University.
          
          Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's "Jana Gana Mana" and Bangladesh's "Amar Shonar Bangla". The Sri Lankan national anthem was also inspired by his work.</p>

      <p id="poetry">Where The Mind Is Without Fear</p>
      <pre><div id="pre">
        Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high
        Where knowledge is free
        Where the world has not been broken up into fragments
        By narrow domestic walls
        Where words come out from the depth of truth
        Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
        Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
        Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
        Where the mind is led forward by thee
        Into ever-widening thought and action
        Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

        <p id="poetry">Unending Love</p>
        <pre><div id="pre">
          I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times…
          In life after life, in age after age, forever.
          My spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs,
          That you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms,
          In life after life, in age after age, forever.
          
          Whenever I hear old chronicles of love, its age-old pain,
          Its ancient tale of being apart or together.
          As I stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge,
          Clad in the light of a pole-star piercing the darkness of time:
          You become an image of what is remembered forever.
          
          You and I have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount.
          At the heart of time, love of one for another.
          We have played alongside millions of lovers, shared in the same
          Shy sweetness of meeting, the same distressful tears of farewell-
          Old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.
          
          Today it is heaped at your feet, it has found its end in you
          The love of all man’s days both past and forever:
          Universal joy, universal sorrow, universal life.
          The memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours –
          And the songs of every poet past and forever.

          If it is not my portion to meet thee in this life
          then let me ever feel that I have missed thy sight
          —let me not forget for a moment,
          let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams
          and in my wakeful hours.
          As my days pass in the crowded market of this world
          and my hands grow full with the daily profits,
          let me ever feel that I have gained nothing
          —let me not forget for a moment,
          let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams
          and in my wakeful hours.
          When I sit by the roadside, tired and panting,
          when I spread my bed low in the dust,
          let me ever feel that the long journey is still before me
          —let me not forget a moment,
          let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams
          and in my wakeful hours.
          When my rooms have been decked out and the flutes sound
          and the laughter there is loud,
          let me ever feel that I have not invited thee to my house
          —let me not forget for a moment,
          let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams
          and in my wakeful hours.

        <pre><div id="pre">
          The night is black and the forest has no end;
          a million people thread it in a million ways.
          We have trysts to keep in the darkness, but where
          or with whom - of that we are unaware.
          But we have this faith - that a lifetime's bliss
          will appear any minute, with a smile upon its lips.
          Scents, touches, sounds, snatches of songs
          brush us, pass us, give us delightful shocks.
          Then peradventure there's a flash of lightning:
          whomever I see that instant I fall in love with.
          I call that person and cry: `This life is blest!
          for your sake such miles have I traversed!'
          All those others who came close and moved off
          in the darkness - I don't know if they exist or not.

          Whom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut?
          Open thine eyes and see thy God is not before thee!
          He is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground
          and where the pathmaker is breaking stones.
          He is with them in sun and in shower,
          and his garment is covered with dust.
          Put off thy holy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil!</div>

          I know that the day will come
          when my sight of this earth shall be lost,
          and life will take its leave in silence,
          drawing the last curtain over my eyes.
          Yet stars will watch at night,
          and morning rise as before,
          and hours heave like sea waves casting up pleasures and pains.
          When I think of this end of my moments,
          the barrier of the moments breaks
          and I see by the light of death
          thy world with its careless treasures.
          Rare is its lowliest seat,
          rare is its meanest of lives.
          Things that I longed for in vain
          and things that I got
          —let them pass.
          Let me but truly possess
          the things that I ever spurned
          and overlooked.

          come with a burst of song.
          When tumultuous work raises its din on all sides shutting me out from
          beyond, come to me, my lord of silence, with thy peace and rest.
          When my beggarly heart sits crouched, shut up in a corner,
          break open the door, my king, and come with the ceremony of a king.
          When desire blinds the mind with delusion and dust, O thou holy one,

          Lest I forget them they never venture to leave me alone.
          But day passes by after day and thou art not seen.
          If I call not thee in my prayers, if I keep not thee in my heart,
          thy love for me still waits for my love.

            and never look behind in regret.
            Thy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its breath.

          Give me the strength to make my love fruitful in service.
           Give me the strength never to disown the poor or bend my knees before insolent might.

          Today my sack is empty. 
          I have given completely whatever I had to give. In return, 
          if I receive anything—some love, 
          some forgiveness—then 
          I will take it with me when I step on the boat that crosses to the festival of the wordless end.
